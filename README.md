# Wakeupcall
PRD Individual Project

1. Overview: Public transportations can be very tiring and time consuming, even more tiring when you didn’t have much time to sleep. Though getting those few minutes of shut-eye can be refreshing, sleeping in a public transport can be risky. This new app however may change those odds. Using a GPS system, you can draw a line on a map where it will trigger loud noises in your headphones when crossing it in the real world. Ultimately waking you up at the perfect moment. Because you will only draw a line on a map, it is easy to use.
